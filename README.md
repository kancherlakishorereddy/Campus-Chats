#### Campus Chats is a micro announcements platform for internal use in Universities. The platform acts as a noticeboard where people of an institution can share any online/offline happenings for others to know about and join in.
#### Campus Chats currently supports the following features:
- #### Users can create and delete posts. Each post has a subject and a body.
- #### Users can choose how long their post should be live for with a maximum limit of 24 hrs.
- #### Posts can be sorted by latest post first, expiring soon first, and can be filtered whether the search term is present in the subject, body, or the author's name.
- #### Users Sign Up and Sign In with the Email IDs provided by their Institution.
- #### On signing up, a confirmation mail is sent with a link to verify their ownership of the Mail ID before giving access to the platform.
